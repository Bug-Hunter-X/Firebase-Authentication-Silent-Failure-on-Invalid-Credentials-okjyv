The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the provided credential is invalid or if there's a network issue during the sign-in process.  This can lead to silent failures where your app doesn't provide clear feedback to the user about what went wrong. For instance, using `signInWithEmailAndPassword` with an incorrect email or password might not trigger an easily catchable error, making debugging difficult.
