# Firebase Authentication Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue with Firebase Authentication: silent failures when using `signInWithEmailAndPassword` with incorrect credentials or network problems.

The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides a solution using more robust error handling.

## Problem
The standard Firebase Authentication error handling might not always provide specific details, leading to difficult-to-debug situations.  This example shows how an invalid email or password can result in no clear error message.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully handling all potential error scenarios within the `.catch` block.  The solution includes checking for specific error codes and providing more user-friendly messages.
